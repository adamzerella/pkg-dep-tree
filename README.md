# pkg-dep-tree

> ðŸŒ² A better `npm list`. 

`npm list` is a really useful tool for visualising your dependency tree. It's quite hard to use within your application and focuses on the `node_modules` folder however. `pkg-dep-tree` aims to empwoer developers to print out **peer dependency** structures given a `package.json` file with support for mono repos.
